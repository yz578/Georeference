Georeference

Description:
This program allows you to search for location names (modern or historical locations) with
contextual data in order to find their latitude-longitude coordinates. You can run the 
code as a program/library or you can just run the servlet or website to use it as a service.

Here is a demo/screencast that shows around a website that uses this service:
